# 911 Emergency Calls - Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing emergency calls information. The dataset includes details such as the location, type of emergency, timestamp, and more. The goal of the analysis is to gain insights into patterns, trends, and distributions within the emergency calls data.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis (`911.csv`) contains emergency calls information, including the following columns:
- `lat`: Latitude of the emergency call location
- `lng`: Longitude of the emergency call location
- `desc`: Description of the emergency call
- `zip`: Zip code of the emergency call location
- `title`: Title of the emergency call
- `timeStamp`: Timestamp of the emergency call
- `twp`: Township of the emergency call location
- `addr`: Address of the emergency call location

The dataset provides a comprehensive overview of emergency calls made over a period of time.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Analysis Steps
1. Data Loading: The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.
2. Data Exploration: Basic exploration of the dataset is performed to understand its structure, features, and summary statistics.
3. Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques are applied to handle missing values, convert data types, and prepare the dataset for analysis.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Various visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and time series plots are used to analyze the distribution of emergency calls, trends over time, top townships with emergency calls, and more.
5. Insights and Findings: Key insights and findings are documented based on the EDA results, highlighting notable patterns, trends, and anomalies in the emergency calls data.

## Files Included
- 911-calls.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data loading, exploration, preprocessing, and analysis.
- 911.csv: Dataset containing emergency calls information.
- README.md: This file providing an overview of the project.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the 911-calls.ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible IDE.
3. Run the code cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
4. Explore the visualizations and insights generated from the analysis.
5. Modify or extend the analysis as needed for further exploration or research.
